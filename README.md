![Image Hover Text](/ss.png)

This was my final project for the Ruby curriculum that I was following from https://www.theodinproject.com/ .

## Installation

To play open your Terminal/Command Line. Navigate to the directory where your version will live. Type in the following:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jmooree30/Chess.git
$ cd chess
$ ruby play_game.rb
```
